libjpeg-turbo Licenses
======================

libjpeg-turbo is covered by two compatible BSD-style open source licenses:

- The IJG (Independent JPEG Group) License, which is listed in
  [README.ijg](README.ijg)

  This license applies to the libjpeg API library and associated programs,
  including any code inherited from libjpeg and any modifications to that
  code.

- The Modified (3-clause) BSD License, which is listed below

  This license applies to the TurboJPEG API library and associated programs,
  [libspng](https://libspng.org) (which is used by cjpeg and djpeg), and the
  build/test system.

  * The TurboJPEG API library wraps the libjpeg API library, so in the context
    of the overall TurboJPEG API library, both the terms of the IJG License and
    the terms of the Modified (3-clause) BSD License apply.
  * cjpeg and djpeg use libspng, so in the context of those programs, both the
    terms of the IJG License and the terms of the Modified (3-clause) BSD
    License apply.


Component Licenses
==================

Some of libjpeg-turbo's modules and internal dependencies are covered by less
restrictive licenses, but in the context of libjpeg-turbo as a whole, the terms
of the less restrictive licenses are subsumed by either the IJG License or the
Modified BSD License.  (In other words, the terms of the less restrictive
licenses are satisfied if the terms of the IJG and Modified BSD Licenses are
satisfied.)

- The libjpeg-turbo SIMD source code and zlib are covered by the
  [zlib License](https://spdx.org/licenses/Zlib.html), which is subsumed by the
  IJG License in the context of the cjpeg and djpeg programs and the libjpeg
  API library.

- Some of the libspng source code is covered by the
  [PNG Reference Library License v2](https://spdx.org/licenses/libpng-2.0.html),
  which is subsumed by the IJG License in the context of the cjpeg and djpeg
  programs and the TurboJPEG API library.

- Most of the libspng source code is covered by the
  [Simplified (2-clause) BSD License](https://spdx.org/licenses/BSD-2-Clause.html),
  which is subsumed by the Modified BSD License in the context of the cjpeg and
  djpeg programs and the TurboJPEG API library.


Complying with the libjpeg-turbo Licenses
=========================================

This section provides a roll-up of the libjpeg-turbo licensing terms, to the
best of our understanding.  This is not a license in and of itself.  It is
intended solely for clarification.

1.  If you are distributing a modified version of the libjpeg-turbo source,
    then:

    1.  You cannot alter or remove any existing copyright or license notices
        from the source.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License
        - Clause 1 of the Modified BSD License

    2.  You must add your own copyright notice to the header of each source
        file you modified, so others can tell that you modified that file.  (If
        there is not an existing copyright header in that file, then you can
        simply add a notice stating that you modified the file.)

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License

    3.  You must include the IJG README file, and you must not alter any of the
        copyright or license text in that file.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 1 of the IJG License

2.  If you are distributing only libjpeg-turbo binaries without the source, or
    if you are distributing an application that statically links with
    libjpeg-turbo, then:

    1.  Your product documentation must include a message stating:

        This software is based in part on the work of the Independent JPEG
        Group.

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the IJG license

    2.  If your binary distribution includes or uses the TurboJPEG API or
        associated programs, cjpeg, or djpeg, then your product documentation
        must include the text of the Modified BSD License (see below.)

        **Origin**
        - Clause 2 of the Modified BSD License

3.  You cannot use the name of the IJG or The libjpeg-turbo Project or the
    contributors thereof in advertising, publicity, etc.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Clause 3 of the Modified BSD License

4.  The authors and distributors do not warrant libjpeg-turbo to be free of
    defects, nor do we accept any liability for undesirable consequences
    resulting from your use of the software.

    **Origin**
    - IJG License
    - Modified BSD License
